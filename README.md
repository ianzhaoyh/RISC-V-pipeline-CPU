# RISC-V-pipeline-CPU
pipelined RV32I(with a little bit flaw)
Built an RISC-V 32-bit pipeline processor using the Logisim simulator that supports instructions (I-type,R-type,B-type,J-type,U-type(LUI)) and implements the Forward Unit
∗ Implemented components:RF32,Branch Unit,Forward Unit,Pipeline Register,ImmGen,ALU,Control Unit
∗ Passed all tests using raw binaries of sorting algorithms compiled from self-written RV32I assembly including
the Forward problem to deal with
